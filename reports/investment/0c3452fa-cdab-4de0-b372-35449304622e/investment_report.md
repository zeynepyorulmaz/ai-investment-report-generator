## Investment Thesis
**1. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) - 50% Allocation**  
- **Thesis:** JPMorgan Chase stands out due to its diversified business model, which allows it to weather economic downturns effectively. The bank's robust capital position and leading market share in investment banking and asset management ensure continued revenue stability. Furthermore, its commitment to technology and innovation enhances its capabilities, promoting growth across various financial services.

**2. Goldman Sachs (GS) - 30% Allocation**  
- **Thesis:** Goldman Sachs is well-positioned in investment banking and asset management, with superior underwriting capabilities. The expansion of its consumer banking segment presents additional growth avenues. With strong client service and a focus on high-margin services, GS is poised for profitability through market cycles, making it a compelling growth investment.

**3. Bank of America (BAC) - 20% Allocation**  
- **Thesis:** While Bank of America is more reliant on traditional banking services, it offers stability through its extensive retail network. The bank's efforts to enhance technology and digital services could improve customer engagement and drive growth over time. While its growth potential may lag behind JPM and GS, BAC offers a solid defensive position within the portfolio.

## Risk Management
- **Diversification:** By allocating 50% to JPMorgan Chase, 30% to Goldman Sachs, and 20% to Bank of America, the portfolio balances risk and growth potential. Each company's strengths mitigate risks associated with their respective weaknesses.
  
- **Monitoring Economic Indicators:** Regularly assess economic indicators (e.g., interest rates, regulatory changes) that could impact the performance of these banks. A proactive approach will allow quick adjustments if market conditions change.
  
- **Technology Integration:** Encourage ongoing investments in technology across all three companies to enhance operational efficiencies and risk management practices, particularly important for managing market fluctuations and evolving customer expectations.
