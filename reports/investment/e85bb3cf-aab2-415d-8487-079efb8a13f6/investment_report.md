### Investment Thesis

**1. XOM (ExxonMobil):**
- **Rationale**: As the top-ranked company, XOM demonstrates strong financial health with a low P/E ratio, a solid dividend yield, and a focus on growth through LNG and exploration in Guyana. The anticipated growth in LNG markets supports a compelling investment case.
  
**2. CVX (Chevron):**
- **Rationale**: With a solid market position and burgeoning investments in renewables, CVX showcases resilience and a strategic pivot towards sustainable energy. Strong YTD performance reflects market confidence and ongoing capital discipline, making it a stable addition to the portfolio.

**3. BP (BP):**
- **Rationale**: Although BP is transitioning towards renewables, which brings inherent risks, its high dividend yield offers income potential. The company’s planned shift towards biofuels and hydrogen production signifies long-term growth potential, which can complement the portfolio's overall strategy.

### Risk Management Approach

- **Diversification**: The portfolio is designed to balance exposure across traditional and emerging energy sectors. XOM’s strength in conventional energy will be complemented by CVX’s activities in renewables, with BP serving as a growth leverage in transitioning energy.
  
- **Market Monitoring**: Regularly assess market conditions, particularly commodity price volatility and regulatory changes. Implement stop-loss strategies to protect against significant downturns, especially for BP due to its transitional phase.

- **Hedging**: Use financial instruments to hedge against risks associated with geopolitical tensions that could affect the energy sector as a whole, particularly for CVX with its international operations.

### Final Actionable Recommendations

1. **Invest 50% in XOM**: Focus on XOM’s strong financials and growth trajectory, especially in the LNG segment. This allocation takes advantage of its robust cash flow to manage potential risks effectively.

2. **Allocate 30% to CVX**: Leverage Chevron’s solid market position and its approach to integrating renewables, which could yield long-term benefits while providing insulation against energy price fluctuations.

3. **Designate 20% to BP**: While acknowledging the transitional risks, BP's high dividend yield can provide income during a period when traditional energy may face challenges. Closely monitor BP’s strategic execution to adjust this allocation as necessary.

This strategic allocation optimally balances risk and potential return across the selected energy companies, allowing for a diversified and resilient portfolio.
